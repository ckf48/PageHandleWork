ver this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.
Perhaps you will ask me
, "Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?"
The reply is simpl
e. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond mys
elf by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.
- we are warned as to the dangers of the baobabs
As each day passed I would lear
n, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very 
slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe o
f the baobabs.
This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly-- as if seized by 
a grave doubt-- "It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?"
"Yes, that is true."
"Ah! I am glad!"
I did not understand
 why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:
"Then it follows that they also eat b
aobabs?"
I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; 
and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.
The idea of the h
erd of elephants made the little prince laugh.
"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.
But he made a wise 
comment: aaaaaaa
"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."
"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you w
ant the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"
He answered me at once, "Oh, come, come!", as if he were speaking of something that wa
s self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.
Indeed, as I lear
ned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived-- as on all planets-- good plants and bad plants. In consequence, th
ere were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of th
e earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and
 begin-- timidly at first-- to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radis
h or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as 
soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.
Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the h
ome of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is so
mething you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores cl
ear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces...
"It is a
 question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it i
s time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly al
l the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in the
ir earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy."
And one day he said to me: "You ought to 
make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them
 if they were to travel some day. Sometimes," he added, "there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But 
when it is a matter of baobabs,  that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected

 looked like
 this:
The grown-ups' response, this time, was to adviseme to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.
So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.
Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:
"That is a hat."
Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
- the narrator crashes in the desert and makes the acquaintance of the little prince
So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:
"If you please-- draw me a sheep!"
"What!"
"Draw me a sheep!"
I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best potrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.
Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:
"But-- what are you doing here?"
And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: "If you please-- draw me a sheep..."
When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I toldthelittle chap (alittle crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:
"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."
But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with,
"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."
So then I made a drawing.
He looked at it carefully, then he said:
"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."
So I made another drawing.
My friend smiled gently and indulgenty.
"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."
So then I did my drawing over once more.
But it was rejected too, just like the others.
"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."
By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.
And I threw out an explanation with it.
"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."
I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"
"Why?"
"Because where I live everything is very small..."
"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."
He bent his head over the drawing:
"Not so small that-- Look! He has gone to sleep..."
And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.
- the narrator learns more about from where the little prince came
It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.
The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:
"What is that object?"
"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."
And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.
He cried out, then:
"What! You dropped down from the sky?"
"Yes," I answered, modestly.
"Oh! That is funny!"
And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.
Then he added:
"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"
At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly:
"Do you come from another planet?"
But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:
"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."
And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.
You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.
"My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"
After a reflective silence he answered:
"The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house."
"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."
But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:
"Tie him! What a queer idea!"
"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."
My friend broke into another peal of laughter:
"But where do you think he would go?"
"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."
Then the little prince said, earnestly:
"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"
And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:
"Straight ahead of him, nobody cangovery far..."

But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.
Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces...

But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes..."
So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. "Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!"
My friends, like myself, have been skirtingthis danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked sohardover this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all thetrouble it has cost me.
Perhaps you will ask me
